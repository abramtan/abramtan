### About me
Hello there! I'm Abram, a computer science undergraduate at SUTD. I have worked at LionsBot, a startup that designs and builds cleaning robots with personalities, and at ST Electronics (Info-Security) doing some cyber-security work. I code in C++, Python, Java, and Swift and look forward to building cool robots and applications that make our lives better!
